# rover-meta-learning

This is code for [Adaptive Meta-Learning for Identification of Rover-Terrain Dynamics](), in which we present a meta-learning based approach to adapt probabilistic predictions of rover dynamics and estimates of terrain parameters by augmenting a nominal model affine in parameters with a Bayesian regression algorithm (P-ALPaCA).
